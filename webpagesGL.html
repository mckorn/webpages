		<!-- A paragraph about myself -->
		<p>Hello! My name is McKenna Corn and I am a <em>computer science</em> student at <strong>NC State</strong>.
		I was born and bred in Charlotte, having lived in the same house my whole life. 
		I share my love for engineering with my dad who is a mechanical engineer and began my <ins>obsession</ins> with taking things apart.
		I enjoy to run, play video games, draw, sew, and occasionally give myself at-home tattoos (much to my mother's dismay). 
		I hope you learned something new about me!
		</p>
		<p>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH is my favourite <del>element</del> chemical formula. E = mc<sup>2</sup> is my favourite physics forumula.</p>
